      <h1>My Journey</h1>
      <br/>
      <p>
        My name is Jia Liang (Ellison) Chen and I am a web developer! My journey of developing software has been long 
        and eventful, starting with C# in the 10th grade. I understood none of it and refused to go back to development...<br/>
        <br/>
        Until inevitably I was forced to take Computer Science for Scientists with Matlab, which is where programming
        started to make sense! I excelled in Matlab, even expanding into Python in Computer Science 1, teaching myself
        the entire cirriculum and achieving a 100% grade.<br/>
        <br/>
        Around the same time, I had started working on JavaScript in a small contracted job I had picked up from a close
        contact and had begun teaching myself JavaScript over one summer.<br/>
        <br/>
        I continued to find programming fascinating, eventually taking UofT's SCS Web Development Flex Stack course, where
        I am thoroughly enjoying learning new concepts and being able to expand my understanding even further!<br/>
        <br/>
        I don't know what the future holds, but I'm sure there will be plenty of programming and I am fully welcoming it
        with open arms!
